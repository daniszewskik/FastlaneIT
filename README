Test fastlane !

Right now the project allows to

* set metadata with 4 languages on a projet, remove all screenshots, and upload 1, then 30, then 120 screenshots

To get started:

1. create a test project on ITC

2. modify the fastlane/.env to contain your user id and project id

3. sh run.sh (the first time, if you haven't entered your Apple credentials, it will ask for them and store them)

If you want to change the screenshots have a look at 

   ruby bin/genimages.rb fixtures

   (this requires ImageMagick)
